# Feature Implementation Priority Plan

This plan breaks your project into prioritized, actionable milestones. Each step can be further divided into GitHub issues/tasks.

---

## 1. User Management & Security
- Sign up/login endpoints
- Password reset flow
- 2FA setup and verification
- User roles (admin, accountant, client)
- Secure session management and JWT middleware
- Audit logs (basic)

**Why first?**  
Everything else depends on having secure user accounts and roles.

---

## 2. Document Upload & Ingestion
- Single and bulk upload endpoints (with basic validation)
- Status tracking for uploads
- Auto-categorization (simple rules, can be enhanced later)
- Connect to cloud storage provider (S3/Azure Blob mock/stub)

**Why next?**  
Document upload is a core user workflow. It doesnâ€™t require full accounting logic and enables testing of storage integration.

---

## 3. Data Storage & Management
- Store document metadata and links in the database
- Document versioning support
- Audit trail for documents

**Why here?**  
Ensures uploaded files and their histories are properly managed and queryable.

---

## 4. Document Processing
- Integrate OCR for images/PDFs (start with open-source, e.g., Tesseract)
- Basic data extraction (regex, stub ML)
- Auto-validation and duplicate detection (basic logic)
- Manual review/correction interface (endpoint stubs)

**Why now?**  
Unlocks automation and the value-added workflow for users.

---

## 5. Accounting Automation
- Journal entry and chart of accounts endpoints
- Weekly bookkeeping job (manual trigger first)
- Bank reconciliation endpoint (exchange rates stubbed or mocked)

**Why now?**  
Enables the main accounting flows and testing with uploaded/processed docs.

---

## 6. Compliance & Filing
- VAT/corporate tax registration and filing workflows
- Filing calendar & reminders
- Pre-fill and generate official forms (PDF, e-signature stub)
- Audit-ready document storage access

**Why now?**  
Builds on document and accounting data, ready for real-world regulatory use cases.

---

## 7. Reporting & Insights
- Basic dashboards (P&L, YTD)
- Exportable reports (PDF/Excel)
- Advisory alerts
- AI-powered insights (stubbed or simple logic)

---

## 8. Notifications & Activity
- System/user notifications for uploads, processing, deadlines, etc.
- Activity feed endpoints

---

## 9. Advisory & Support
- Knowledge base and FAQ endpoints
- AI chat (stub integration)
- Scheduling advisory sessions

---

## Notes

- Each stage can be released incrementally for early feedback.
- Stubs/mocks for complex integrations allow frontend/client work in parallel.
- Security and audit logging should be improved continuously at each stage.

**Next Step:**  
Break down the first priority (User Management & Security) into detailed tasks/issues and start implementation!
